Based on the Machine Learning I have decided to do.
<br/>So I have applied to a machine learning course on Udemy.
<br/>And I also learn from some awesome tutorials on youtube.
<br/>I have planned on updating with projects I do on my own with certain real world problems other than those that are used in the course.
<br/>So that I get to practically apply what I learn instead of copying.
<br/>**Some of these datasets are created by me and may not be accurate, just for practice purposes**
