Based on the Machine Learning I have decided to do.
So I have applied to a machine learning course on Udemy.
Ad I also checked a lot of awesome tutorials on youtube.
I have planned on updating with projects I do on my own with certain real world problems other than those that are used in the course.
So that I get to practically apply what I learn instead of copying.
